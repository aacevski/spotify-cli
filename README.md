#### Spotify CLI

This project was a way of me to start learning [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/). So after learning about some of the basics I've decided to create a small CLI tool.

In the future I plan to extend this tool so you can control your Spotify playback.

If you'd like to try this tool on your own and experiment, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
```
SPOTIFY_ID=YOUR_ID_HERE
SPOTIFY_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_HERE
```
